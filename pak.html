<p><span  style="color: darkgreen;  font-weight: bold;">Independance Day (Urdu: یوم آزادی Yuaum-e-Azadi)</span> Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan,[13] the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age,[14][15] and the ancient Gandhara civilisation.[16] The regions that comprise the modern state of Pakistan were the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[17] the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Samma, the Hindu Shahis, the Shah Miris, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals,[18] and most recently, the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.</p>
<h2 style="background-color: darkgreen; color: white">Provinces Of Pakistan</h2>
There are five provinces of pakistan
<h3 style="background-color: darkgreen;color: white;">Sindh</h3>
<p><span  style="color: darkgreen    ;font-weight: bold;">Sindh was the site of one of the Cradle of civilizations,</span> the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilisation thise to the Iron Age vedic civilization, which lasted till 500 BC. During this era, the Vedas, the oldest and primary Hindu scriptures were composed. In 518 BC, the Achaemenid empire conquered Indus valley and established Hindush satrapy in Sindh. Following Alexander the Great's invasion, Sindh became part of the Mauryan Empire. After its decline, Indo-Greeks, Indo-Scythians and Indo-Parthians ruled in Sindh.</p>
<h3  style="background-color: darkgreen;color: white;">Punjab</h3>
<p><span  style="color: darkgreen   ;font-weight: bold;">Following the decline and subsequent fall of the Mughal Empire, Maharaja Ranjeet Singh was the most prominent ruler of the Punjab </span>. He established the Sikh Empire that lasted from 1799-1849.  During his time a lot of importance was given to the landed aristocracy and he relied upon their loyal support to retain power. However, after his death, political chaos ensued and two of his successor maharajas were assassinated in the succession struggle. The British Empire took control and annexed Punjab in 1849 after two Anglo Sikh Wars.</p>
<h3  style="background-color: darkgreen;color: white;">Balochistan</h3>
<p><span  style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">Balochistan (balochi: بلوچستان)</span> and Pashtoons are two prominent ethnic groups residing in Balochistan, contributing to the region’s diverse cultural tapestry. The Baloch, known for their rich history and distinct language, have inhabited the region for centuries. They have a strong sense of identity and have played a significant role in shaping Balochistan’s political landscape. On the other hand, the Pashtoons, also known as Pathans, have a sizable population in Balochistan, particularly in the northern parts. They bring their unique traditions, language, and customs, adding to the multicultural fabric of Balochistan. Both communities coexist and contribute to the social and economic development of the region.</p>
<h3   style="background-color: darkgreen;color: white;">NWFP</h3>
<p><span  style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( خیبر پختونخواہ)</span>The northwestern frontier areas were annexed by the East India Company after the Second Sikh War (1848–49). The territories thenceforth formed a part of Punjab until the province, then known as North West Frontier Province, was created in 1901 from the north-western districts of the Punjab Province.[4] This region, along with the 'Frontier Tribal Areas', acted as a buffer zone with Afghanistan.</p>
<h3  style="background-color: darkgreen;color: white;">Gilgit baltistan</h3>
<p><span  style="color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;">Gilgit Baltistan ( گلگت بلتستان) </span> region, together with Azad Kashmir in the southwest, is grouped and referred to by the United Nations and other international organisations as "Pakistan-administered Kashmir".[note 1] Gilgit-Baltistan is six times larger than Azad Kashmir in terms of geographical area.[18]</p>
